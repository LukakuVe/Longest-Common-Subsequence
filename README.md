# Longest-Common-Subsequence
This code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem of finding the Longest Common Subsequence of two strings. It defines the function longest_common_subsequence, which takes two strings as input and returns the longest common subsequence. Then, the function is called with two sample strings, and the result is printed to the console.
